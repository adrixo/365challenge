If you list all positive integers less than or equal to 20, you get this:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

If you count the number of times the digit "1" appears in that list, you get 12. 
Define a function f(n) which gives the number of 1's needed to write out all
numbers 1 to n in decimal notation.

Here is a couple of example values for f(n):

f(20) = 12
f(1234) = 689
f(5123) = 2557
f(70000) = 38000
f(123321) = 93395
f( 3^35 ) = 90051450678399649
