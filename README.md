# 365challenge
Adrián Valera's 365 days programming challenge

Most challenges belong to daily programmer

* [dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)


The programs are distributed in folders depending on the dificulty:

* /Month/
	/easy

	/medium

	/hard

Each file number its related with the nº of challenge in dailyprogrammer webpage.
At the same time, each month has its own folder, where I'll maybe post the vessel logbook.

I try to use different languages testing myself where I feel most clumsy, although there is a clear C predominance.
