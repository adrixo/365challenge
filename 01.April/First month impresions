1st month impresions

I faced this situation quietly, focusing on heating engines with basic 
programs in c/python; I realised that in many situations I was less 
accurate than expected, having to search some basic things in the 
documentation or on the internet due to foolish failures.

I'm going to try to use more python and enter in languages where i find 
myself insecure as perl.
Surprisingly I started to enjoy python too much, my first language, 
lernt time ago and abandoned. When you use a programming languaje that 
you have not studied in depth on your own you end up spending much more 
time for a program of many less lines than for example if you had 
implemented in c, but you spend more time researching and looking at 
code from other people, and that's great.

On the one hand I have found myself very well with C, many of the 
concepts that I previously considered compex I apply them fluidly, 
paradoxically on the other hand I commit silly failures or I find 
difficulty to be abstracted. 

Also at the time of coding I find myself going to spanish and I make 
small mistakes that I thought I had overcome, I has been a good idea 
to start this challenge, I hope to fulfill what I have proposed, 
although some exercises are short or easy, entering on a certain 
routine is not so simple for me that I'm in college.
I'm going to stop a few days, trying to fit the month of the challenge 
with the calendar and preparing myself to face the final exams.

Abstraction, that great word that accompanies programming, an elegant 
lost of ego in favor of the understanding of reality. 
Amor veritas amor rei.
